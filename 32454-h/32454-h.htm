<p>It is a venerable and beautiful rite which commands the
Chinese not only to establish in their dwellings a Hall of
Ancestors, devoted to memorials of kindred who are dead, but
which obliges them, on a certain day of every year, to quit
the ordinary toils of life and hasten to the tombs of their Forefathers,
where, with mingled services of festivity and worship,
they pass the hours in honoring the manes of those
whom they have either loved or been taught to respect for
their virtues.</p>

<p>This is a wholesome and ennobling exercise of the memory.
It teaches neither a blind allegiance to the past, nor a superstitious
reverence for individuals; but it is a recognition of
the great truth that no man is a mere isolated being in the
great chain of humanity, and that, while we are not selfishly
independent of the past, so also, by equal affinity, we are connected
with and control the fate of those who are to succeed
us in the drama of the world.</p>

<p>The Time that merges in Eternity, sinks like a drop in the
ocean, but the deeds of that Time, like the drop in the deep,
are again exhaled and fitted for new uses; so that although
the Time be dead, the acts thereof are immortal&mdash;for the
achieved action never perishes. That which was wrought, in
innocence or wrong, is eternal in its results or influences.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>This reflection inculcates a profound lesson of our responsibility.
It teaches us the value of assembling to look over
the account of the past; to separate the good from the false;
to winnow the historical harvest we may have reaped; to
survey the heavens, and find our place on the ocean after the
storm. And if such conduct is correct in the general concerns
of private life, how much more is it proper when we
remember the duty we owe to the founders of great principles,&mdash;to
the founders of great states,&mdash;of great states that
have grown into great nations! In this aspect the principle
rises to a dignity worthy our profoundest respect. History is
the garnered treasure of the past, and it is from the glory or
shame of that past, that nations, like individuals, take heart
for the coming strife, or sink under irresistible discouragement.</p>

<p>Is it not well, then, that we, the people of this large country,
divided as we are in separate governments, should assemble,
at proper seasons, to celebrate the foundations of our time-honored
commonwealths; and, while each state casts its annual
tribute on the altar of our country, each should brighten
its distinctive symbols, before it merges their glory in that
great constellation of American nations, which, in the political
night that shrouds the world, is the only guiding sign for
unfortunate but hopeful humanity!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When the Reformation in England destroyed the supremacy
of the Roman Church, and the Court set the example
of a new faith, it may readily be supposed, that the people
were sorely taxed when called on to select between the dogmas
they had always cherished, and those they were authoritatively
summoned to adopt. The age was not one either of
free discussion or of printing and publication. Oral arguments,
and not printed appeals, were the only means of reaching
the uncultivated minds of the masses, and even of a large
portion of the illiterate gentry and aristocracy. If we reflect,
with what reverence creeds are, even now, traditionally
inherited in families, we must be patient with their entailed
tenure in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The soul of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
nations cannot be purged of its ancestral faith by Acts of Parliament.
There may be submission to law, external indifference,
hypocritical compliance, but, that implicit adoption
and correspondent honest action, which flow from conscientious
belief, must spring from sources of very different
sanctity.</p>

<p>When the world contained only one great Christian Church,
the idea of Union betwixt that Church and the State, was not
fraught with the disgusts or dangers that now characterize it.
There were then no sects. All were agreed on one faith, one
ritual, one interpretation of God's law, and one infallible
expositor; nor was it, perhaps, improper that this law&mdash;thus
ecclesiastically expounded and administered in perfect national
unity of faith&mdash;should be the rule of civil and political, as well
as of religious life. Indeed, it is difficult, even now, to
separate the ideas; for, inasmuch as God's law is a law of life,
and not a mere law of death&mdash;inasmuch as it controls all our
relations among ourselves and thus defines our practical duty
to the Almighty&mdash;it is difficult, I repeat, to define wherein
the law of man should properly differ from the law of God.
Mere morality&mdash;mere political morality,&mdash;is nothing but a
bastard policy, or another name for expediency, unless it
conforms in all its motives, means and results, to religion.
In truth, morality, social as well as political, to be vital and
not hypocritical, must be religion put into practical exercise.
This is the simple, just, and wise reconciliation of religion and
good government, which I humbly believe to be, ever and
only, founded upon Christianity. But it was a sad mistake
in other days, to confound a Primitive Christianity and the
dogmas of a Historical Church. Unfortunately for the ancient
union of Church and State, this great identification of the true
christian action of the civil and ecclesiastical bodies, was
but a mere fiction, so far as religion was concerned, and
a fact, only so far as power was interested. Christianity
ever has remained, and ever will remain, the same radiant
unit; but a church, with irresponsible power&mdash;a church
which, at best, is but an aggregation of human beings,
with all the passions, as well as all the virtues of our race&mdash;soon,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
necessarily, abandons the purity of its early time, and
grows into a vast hierarchy, which, founding its claims to
authority on divine institution, sways the world, sometimes
for good and sometimes for evil, with a power suited to the
asserted omnipotence of its origin.</p>

<p>But the idea of honest union between church and state was
naturally destroyed, in the minds of all right thinking persons,
from the moment that there was a secession from the Church
of Rome. The very idea, I assert, was destroyed; for the
Catholic Princes and the sects into which Protestants divided
themselves, began an internecine war, which, in effect, not
only forever obliterated supremacy from the vocabulary of
ecclesiastical power, but almost destroyed, by disgracing, the
religion in whose name it perpetrated its remorseless cruelties.</p>

<p>The social as well as religious anarchy consequent upon
the Reformation, was soon discerned by the statesmen of
England, who took council with prudent ecclesiastics, and,
under the authority of law, erected the Church of England.
In this new establishment they endeavored to substitute for
Romanism, a new ecclesiastical system, which, by its concessions
to the ancient faith, its adoption of novel liberalities,
its compromises and its purity, might contain within itself,
sufficient elements upon which the adherents of Rome might
gracefully retreat, and to which the Reformers might either
advance or become reconciled. This scheme of legislative
compromise for a national religion, was doubtless, not merely
designed as an amiable neutral ground for the spiritual wants
of the people, but as the nucleus of an institution which would
gradually, if not at once, transfer to the Royalty of England,
that spiritual authority which its sovereigns had found it irksome
to bear or to control when wielded by the Pope.</p>

<p>The architects of this modern faith were not wrong in their
estimate of the English people, for, perhaps, the great body
of the nation willingly adopted the new scheme. Yet there
were bitter opponents both among the Catholics and Calvinists,
whose extreme violence admitted no compromise,
either with each other, or with the Church of England. For
them there was no resource but in dumbness or rebellion; and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
as many a lip opened in complaint or attempted seduction,
the legislature originated that charitable and reconciling
system of disabilities and penalties, which a pliant judiciary
was not slow in enforcing with suitable rigor. While the
Puritan could often fairly yield a sort of abstinent conformity
which saved him from penalties, the Roman Catholic, who
adhered faithfully and conscientiously to his ancestral church,
made no compromise with his allegiance. Accordingly, on
him, the unholy and intolerant law fell with all its persecuting
bane.</p>

<p>"About the middle of the reign of Queen Elizabeth there
arose among the Calvinists, a small body, who bore nearly
the same relation to them, which they bore to the great body
of the Reformed; these were ultra Puritans, as they were
ultra Protestants. These persons deemed it their religious
duty to separate themselves entirely from the church, and, in
fact, to war against it. The principle upon which they
founded themselves, was, that there should be no national
church at all, but that the whole nation should be cast in a
multitude of small churches or congregations, each self-governed,
and having only, as they believed, the officers of
which we read in the New Testament,&mdash;pastor, teacher, elder
and deacon."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Such was the ecclesiastical and political aspect of England,
and of a part of Scotland, about the period when the First
James ascended the British throne. As there is nothing
that so deeply concerns our welfare as the rights and duties
of our soul, it is not at all singular to find how quickly
men became zealous in the assertion of their novel privileges,
as soon as they discovered that there were two ways
of interpreting God's law, or, at least, two modes of worshiping
him,&mdash;one wrapped in gorgeous ceremonial, the other
stripped in naked simplicity,&mdash;and that the right to this
interpretation or worship was not only secured by law,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
but was inherent in man's nature. Personal interests may
be indolently neglected or carelessly pursued. It is rare to
see men persecute each other about individual rights or properties.
Yet, such is not the case when a right or an interest
is the religious property of a multitude. Then, community of
sentiment or of risk, bands them together in fervent support,
and when the thing contended for is based on conscience and
<i>eternal</i> interest, instead of personal or <i>temporary</i> welfare, we
behold its pursuit inflame gradually from a principle into a
passion,&mdash;from passion into persecution, until at length, what
once glimmered in holy zeal, blazes in bigoted fanaticism.
Thus, all persecutors may not, originally, be bad men, though
their practices are wicked. The very liberty of conscience
which freemen demand, must admit this to be possible in the
conduct of those who differ from us most widely in faith
and politics.</p>

<p>Religious Conscience, therefore, is the firmest founder of
the right of forming and asserting Free Opinions; and when
it has securely established the great fact of Religious Freedom,
it at once, as an immediate consequence, realizes Political
Freedom, which is nothing but the individual right independently
to control our personal destinies, as well as to shape
our conscientious spiritual destinies. The right of free judgment
asserts that Christianity put into vital exercise, in our
social or national relations, is, in fact, the essence of pure
democracy. It is liberty of action that produces responsibility&mdash;it
is equal responsibility that makes us <i>one</i> before the
law. To teach man the humility and equality of his race, <i>as
rights</i>; and to illustrate the glorious lesson that from the
cottage and cabin have sprung the intellects that filled the
world with light, it pleased the Almighty to make a stable
the birth-place of our Redeemer, and a manger his lowly
cradle!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When the valiant men of olden times had checked the corporate
system of theology in England and Germany, and established
their right, at least, <i>to think</i> for themselves; and when
the Reformation had subsequently received a countercheck in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Germany, England and France,&mdash;the stalwart, independent
worshippers, who could no longer live peacefully together
within their native realms, began to cast about for an escape
from the persecutions of non-conformity and the mean
"tyranny of incapacitation."</p>

<p>The Reformation was the work of the early part of the
sixteenth century. The close of the fifteenth had been signalized
by the discovery of America, and by the opening of
a maritime communication with India. The East, though
now accessible by water, was still a far distant land. The
efforts of all navigators, even when blundering on our continent,
were, in truth, not to find a new world, but to reach
one already well known for the richness of its products, and
the civilization of its people. But distant as it was, it presented
no field for colonization. It was the temporary object
of mercantile and maritime enterprise, and although colonial
lodgments were impracticable on its far off shores, it nevertheless
permitted the establishment of factories which served,
in the unfrequent commerce of those ages, as almost regal
intermediaries between Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>But the Western World was both nearer, and, for a while,
more alluring to avarice and enterprise. It was not a civilized,
populous, and warlike country like the East, but it possessed
the double temptation of wealth and weakness. The fertility
of the West Indies, the reports of prodigious riches, the conquests
of Cortez and Pizzaro, the emasculated semi-civilization
of the two Empires, which, with a few cities and royal
courts, combined the anomaly of an almost barbarous though
tamely tributary people&mdash;had all been announced throughout
Europe. Yet, the bold, brave and successful Spaniard of those
days contrived for a long while to reap the sole benefit of the
discovery. What he effected was done by <i>conquest</i>. <i>Colonization</i>,
which is a gradual settlement, either under enterprise
or persecution, was to follow.</p>

<p>The conquest and settlement of the Southern part of this
continent are so well known, that it is needless for me to dwell
on them; but it is not a little singular that the very first effort
at what may strictly be called colonization, within the present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
acknowledged limits of the United States, was owing to the
spirit of persecution which was so rife in Europe.</p>

<p>The Bull of the Pope, in its division of the world, had
assigned America to Spain. Florida, which had been discovered
by Ponce de Leon, and the present coast of our
Republic on the Gulf of Mexico, were not, in the sixteenth
century, disputed with Spain by any other nation. Spain
claimed, however, under the name of Florida, the whole sea-coast
as far as Newfoundland and even to the remotest
north, so that, so far as <i>asserted</i> ownership was involved, the
whole of our coast was Spanish domain.</p>

<p>The poor, persecuted, weather-beaten Huguenots of France,
had been active in plans of Colonization for escape from the
mingled imbecility and terrorism of Charles IX. They saw
that it was not well to stay in the land of their birth.
The Admiral de Coligny, one of the ablest leaders of the
French Protestants, was zealous in his efforts to found a
Gallic empire of his fellow subjects and sufferers on this continent.
He desired, at least, a refuge for them; and in 1562,
entrusted to John Ribault, of Dieppe, the command of an
expedition to the American shores. The first soil of this
virgin hemisphere that was baptised by the tread of refugees
flying from the terrors of the future hero of St. Bartholomew&mdash;of
men who were seeking freedom from persecution for the
sake of their religion&mdash;was that of South Carolina. Ribault
first visited St. John's River, in Florida, and then slowly
coasted the low shores northward, until he struck the indenture
where Hilton-Head Island, and Hunting and St.
Helen's Islands are divided by the entrance into the ocean of
Broad River at Port Royal.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful region, where venerable oaks shadowed
a luxuriant soil, while the mild air, delicious with the fragrance
of forest-flowers, forever diffused a balmy temperature, free
alike from the fire of the tropics and the frost of the north.
Here, in this pleasant region, he built Fort Carolina, and
landed his humble colony of twenty persons who were to keep
possession of the chosen land.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>But Frenchmen are not precisely at home in the wilderness.
They require the aggregation of large villages or cities. The
Frenchman is a social being, and regret for the loss of civil
comforts soon spoils his vivacious temper, and fills him with
discontent. Accordingly, dissensions broke forth in the
colony soon after the departure of Ribault for France; and,
most of the dissatisfied colonists, finding their way back to
Europe as best they could, the settlement was broken up
forever.</p>

<p>Yet, Coligny was not to be thwarted. In 1564, he again
resolved to colonize Florida, and entrusted Laudonni&egrave;re&mdash;a
seaman rather than a soldier, who had already visited the
American coasts,&mdash;with three ships which had been conceded
by the king. An abundance of colonists, not disheartened by
the failure of their predecessors, soon offered for the voyage,
and, after a passage of sixty days, the eager adventurers
hailed the American coast. They did not go to the old site,
marked as it was by disaster, but nestled on the embowered
banks of the beautiful St. John's, or, as it was then known&mdash;"The
River of May."</p>

<p>But the French of that era, when in pursuit of qualified self-government
or of any principle, either civil or religious, were
not unlike their countrymen of the present time. They found
it difficult to make enthusiasm subordinate to the mechanism
of progress, and to restrain the elastic vapor which properly
directed gives energy to humanity, but which heedlessly
handled destroys what it should impel or guide. Religious
enthusiasm is not miraculously fed by ravens in the wilderness.
Coligny's emigrants were improvident or careless settlers.
Their supplies wasted. They were not only gratified by the
sudden relief from royal oppression, but the removal of a
weight, gave room for the display of that secret avarice, which,
more or less, possesses the hearts of all men. They had heard
of the Spaniard's success, and were seized with a passion for
sudden wealth. They became discontented with the toil of
patient labor and slow accretion. Mutiny ripened into rebellion.
A party compelled Laudonni&egrave;re to suffer it to embark
for Mexico; but its two vessels were soon employed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
piratical enterprises against the Spaniards. Some of the
reckless insurgents fell into the hands of the men they assailed,
and were made prisoners and sold as slaves, while the few
who escaped, were, on their return, executed by orders of
Laudonni&egrave;re.</p>

<p>The main body of the colonists who had either remained
true to their duty or were kept in subjection, had, meanwhile,
become greatly disheartened by these occurrences and by the
failing supplies of their settlement, when they were temporarily
relieved by the arrival of the celebrated English adventurer&mdash;Sir
John Hawkins. Ribault soon after came out
from France to take command, and brought with him new
emigrants, seeds, animals, agricultural implements, and fresh
supplies of every kind.</p>

<p>These occurrences, it will be recollected, took place in
Florida, within the ancient claim of Spain. It is true that
the country was a wilderness; but Spain still asserted her
dominion, though no beneficial use had been made of the
neglected forest and tangled swamp. At this epoch, a certain
Pedro Melendez de Aviles&mdash;a coarse, bold, bloody man, who
signalized himself in the wars in Holland against the Protestants,
and was renowned in Spanish America for deeds
which, even in the loose law of that realm, had brought him
to justice, was then hanging about the Court of Philip II. in
search of plunder or employment. He perceived a tempting
"mission" of combined destruction and colonization in the
French Protestant settlement in Florida; and, accordingly, a
compact was speedily made between himself and his sovereign,
by which he was empowered, in consideration of certain
concessions and rights, to invade Florida with at least
five hundred men, and to establish the Spanish authority and
Catholic religion.</p>

<p>An expedition, numbering under its banner more than
twenty-five hundred persons, was soon prepared. After
touching, with part of these forces, on the Florida coast, in
the neighborhood of the present river Matanzas, the adventurer
sailed in quest of the luckless Huguenots, whose vessels
were soon descried escaping seaward from a combat for which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
they were unprepared. For a while, Melendez pursued them,
but abandoning the chase, steered south once more, and entering
the harbor on the coast he had just before visited, laid the
foundations of that quaint old Spanish town of <span class="smcap">St. Augustine</span>,
which is the parent of civic civilization on our continent.
Ribault, meanwhile, who had put to sea with his craft, lost
most of his vessels in a sudden storm on the coast, though the
greater part of his companions escaped.</p>

<p>But Melendez, whose ships suffered slightly from this
tempest, had no sooner placed his colonists in security, at
St. Augustine, than he set forth with a resolute band across
the marshy levels which intervened between his post and the
St. John's. With savage fury the reckless Spaniard fell on
the Huguenots. The carnage was dreadful. It seems to
have been rather slaughter than warfare. The Huguenots,
unprepared for battle, little dreamed that the wars of the old
world would be transferred to the new, and vainly imagined
that human passion could find victims enough for its malignity
without crossing the dangerous seas. Full two hundred
fell. Many fled to the forest. A few surrendered, and were
slain. Some escaped in two French vessels that fortunately
still lingered in the harbor. The wretches who had been providentially
saved from the wreck, were next followed and found
by this Castilian monster. "Let them surrender their flags
and arms," said he, "and thus placing themselves at my
discretion, I may do with them what God in his mercy
desires!" Yet, as soon as they yielded, they were bound and
marched through the forest to St. Augustine, and, as they
approached the fort which had been hastily raised on the level
shores, the sudden blast of a trumpet was the signal for the
musketeers to pour into the crowd a volley that laid them
dead on the spot. It was asserted that these victims of reliance
on Spanish mercy, were massacred, "not as Frenchmen,
but as Lutherans;"&mdash;and thus, about nine hundred Protestant
human beings, were the first offering on the soil of our
present Union to the devilish fanaticism of the age.</p>

<p>But the bloody deed was not to go unrevenged. A bold
Gascon, Dominic de Gourgues, in 1567, equipped three ships<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and set sail for Florida. He swooped down suddenly, like a
falcon on the forts at the mouth of the St. John's, and putting
the occupants to the sword, hanged them in the forest, inscribing
over their dangling corpses, this mocking reply to the
taunt at the Lutherans: "I do this not as unto Spaniards and
sailors, but as unto murderers, robbers and traitors!"</p>

<p>The revenge was merciless; and thus terminated the first
chapter in the history of religious liberty in America. BLOOD
stained the earliest meeting between Catholic and Protestant
on the present soil of our Union!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The power of Spain, the unattractiveness of our coast, the
indifferent climate, and the failure to find wealthy native
nations to plunder, kept the northern part of our continent in
the back ground for the greater part of a century after the
voyages of Columbus and Cabot. There were discouragements
at that time for mercantile or maritime enterprise,
which make us marvel the more at the energy of the men
who with such slender vessels and knowledge of navigation,
tempted the dangers of unknown seas.</p>

<p>Emigration from land to land, from neighboring country
to neighboring country, was, at that epoch, a formidable
enterprise; what then must we think of the hardihood, or
compulsion, which could either tempt or drive men, not only
over conterminous boundaries, but across distant seas?
Feudal loyalty and the strong tie of family, bound them not
only to their local homes, but to their native land. The lusty
sons of labor were required to till the soil, while their stalwart
brethren, clad in steel, were wandering on murderous errands,
over half of Europe, fighting for Protestantism or Catholicity.
Adventure, then, in the shape of colonization, must hardly
be thought of, from the inland states of the old world; and,
even from the maritime nations, with the exception of Spain
and Portugal, we find nothing worthy of record, save the
fisheries on the Banks, the small settlements of the French
in Acadia and along the St. Lawrence, and the holy efforts of
Catholic Missionaries among the Northern Indians. If we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
did not know their zeal to have been Christian, it might
almost be considered romantic.</p>

<p>Soon after the return of De Gourgues from his revengeful
exploit, the report of the daring deed and its provocation,
was spread over Europe, and excited the people's attention
to America more eagerly than ever. Among those who
were attracted to the subject, was a British gentleman, whose
character and misfortunes have always engaged my sincere
admiration.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Raleigh was the natural offspring of the remarkable
age in which he lived. We owe him our profoundest
respect, for it was Sir Walter who gave the first decided
impulse to our race's beneficial enjoyment of this continent.
It was his fortune to live at a time of great and various action.
The world was convulsed with the throes of a new civilization,
and the energy it exhibited was consequent upon its long
repose. It was an age of transition. It was an age of coat
and corselet&mdash;of steel and satin&mdash;of rudeness and refinement,&mdash;in
which the antique soldier was melting into the
modern citizen. It was the twilight of feudalism. Baronial
strongholds were yielding to municipal independence.
Learning began to teach its marvels to the masses; warfare
still called chivalrous men to the field; a spirited queen,
surrounded by gallant cavaliers, sat on a dazzling throne;
adventurous commerce armed splendid navies and nursed a
brood of hardy sailors; while the mysterious New World
invited enterprise to invade its romantic and golden depths.
It was peculiarly an age of thought and action; and is
characterized by a vitality which is apparent to all who
recollect its heroes, statesmen, philosophers and poets.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Raleigh was destined, by his deeds and his
doom, to bring this northern continent, which we are now
enjoying, into prominent notice. He was the embodiment
of the boyhood of our new world. In early life he had
been a soldier, but the drift of his genius led him into
statesmanship. He was a well known favorite of the Virgin
Queen. A spirit of adventure bore him across the Atlantic,
where, if the occasion had offered, he would have rivalled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Cortez in his courageous hardihood, and outstripped him in
his lukewarm humanity. He became a courtier; and, mingling
in the intrigues of the palace, according to the morals of
the age, was soon too great a favorite with his sovereign to
escape the dislike of men who beheld his sudden rise with
envy. From the palace he passed to prison; and, scorning
the idleness which would have rusted so active an intellect, he
prepared that remarkable History of the World, wherein he
concentrated a mass of rare learning, curious investigation, and
subtle thought, which demonstrate the comprehensive and
yet minute character of his wonderful mind. A volume of
poems shows how sweetly he could sing. The story of his
battles, discloses how bravely he could fight. The narrative
of his voyages proves the boldness of his seamanship. The
calmness of his prison life teaches us the manly lesson of
endurance. The devotion of his wife, denotes how deeply he
could love; while his letters to that cherished woman&mdash;those
domestic records in which the heart divulges its dearest
secrets&mdash;teem with proofs of his affection and Christianity.
Indeed, the gallantry of his courtiership; the foresight of his
statecraft; the splendid dandyism of his apparel; the wild
freedom and companionship of his forest life, show how completely
the fop and the forager, the queenly pet and loyal
subject, the author and the actor, the noble and the democrat,
the soldier and the scholar, were, in the age of Elizabeth and
James, blent in one man, and that man&mdash;Sir Walter Raleigh.</p>

<p>Do we not detect in this first adventurous and practical
patron of North America, many of the seemingly discordant
qualities which mingle so commonly in the versatile life of
our own people? If the calendar of courts had its saints, like
the calendar of the church, well might Sir Walter have been
canonized as protector of the broad realm for which the brutal
James made him a martyr to the jealousy and fear of Spain.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth was the first British Sovereign who built
up that maritime power of England which has converted her
magnificent Island&mdash;dot as it is, in the waste of the sea&mdash;into
the wharf of the world. She was no friend of the Spaniards,
and she had men in her service who admired Spanish galeons.
Wealth, realized in coin, and gold or silver, in bulk, were
tempting merchandize in frail vessels, which sailors, half
pirate, half privateer, might easily deliver of their burden. It
was easier to rob than to mine; and, while Spain performed
the labor in the bowels of the earth, England took the profit
as a prize on the sea! Such were some of the elements of
maritime success, which weakened Spain by draining her
colonial wealth, while it enriched her rival and injured the
Catholic sovereign.</p>

<p>Yet, in the ranks of these adventurers, there were men of
honest purpose; and, among the first whose designs of colonization
on this continent were unquestionably conceived in
a spirit of discovery and speculation, was the half brother of
Sir Walter Raleigh&mdash;Sir Humphrey Gilbert. But Sir Humphrey,
while pursuing his northern adventures, was unluckily
lost at sea, and Sir Walter took up the thread where his relative
dropped it. I regret that I have not time to pursue this
subject, and can only say that his enterprises were, doubtless,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the germ of that colonization, which, by degrees, has filled
up and formed our Union.</p>

<p>You will remember the striking difference between colonization
from England, and the colonization from other nations
of ancient and modern times. The short, imperfect navigation
of the Greeks, along the shores and among the islands of their
inland sea, made colonization rather a diffusive overflow,
than an adventurous transplanting of their people. They
were urged to this oozing emigration either by personal want,
by the command of law, or by the oracles of their gods, who
doubtless spoke under the authority of law. Where the
national religion was a unit in faith, there was no persecution
to drive men off, nor had the spirit of adventure seized those
primitive classics with the zeal of "annexation" that animated
after ages.</p>

<p>The Roman colonies were massive, military progresses of
population, seeking to spread national power by conquest and
permanent encampment.</p>

<p>Portugal and Spain, mingled avarice and dominion in their
conquests or occupation of new lands.</p>

<p>The French Protestants were, to a great extent, prevented
by the bigotry of their home government, as well as by foreign
jealousy, from obtaining a sanctuary in America. France
drove the refugees chiefly into other European countries,
where they established their manufacturing industry; and
thus, fanaticism kept out of America laborious multitudes who
would have pressed hard on the British settlements. In the
islands, a small trade and the investment of money, rather
than the desire to acquire fortune by personal industry, were
the motives of the early and regular emigration of Frenchmen.</p>

<p>The Dutch, devoted to trade, generally located themselves
where they "have just room enough to manifest the miracles
of frugality and diligence."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Thus, wherever we trace mankind abandoning its home,
in ancient or modern days, we find a selfish motive, a
superstitious command, a love of wealth, a lust of power, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
a spirit of robbery, controlling the movement. The first
adventurous effort towards the realization of actual settlement
on this continent, was, as we have seen, made by the persecuted
Huguenots, and was, probably, an attempt rather to fly
from oppression, than to establish religious freedom. The
first English settlement, also, was founded more upon speculation
than on any novel or exalted principle. There was
a quest of gold, a desire for land, and an honest hope of
improving personal fortunes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Virginia</span> had been a charter government, but, in 1624,
it was merged in the Royal Government. The crown reassumed
the dominion it had granted to others. Virginia,
in the first two decades of the seventeenth century, although
exhibiting some prosperous phases, was nothing more than a
delicate off-shoot from the British stock, somewhat vigorous
for its change to virgin soil, but likely to bear the same fruit
as its parent tree. Virginia was a limb timidly transplanted,&mdash;not
a branch torn off, and flung to wither or to fertilize new
realms by its decay. This continent, with all that a century
and a half of maritime coasting had done for it, was but
thinly sprinkled with settlements, which bore the same proportion
to the vast continental wilderness that single ships
or small squadrons bear to the illimitable sea. But the spirit
of adventure, the desire for refuge, the dream of liberty, were
soon to plant the seeds of a new civilization in the Western
World.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Henry VIII, Founder of the English Church, as he had,
whilom, been, Defender of the Roman Faith, was no friend
of toleration; but the rigor of his system was somewhat
relaxed during the reign of the sixth Edward. Mary,
daughter of Henry, and sister of Edward, re-constructed
the great ancestral church, and the world is hardly divided
in opinion as to the character of her reign. Elizabeth re-established
the church that had been founded by her father;
and her successor James I of England and VI of Scotland,&mdash;the
Protestant son of a Catholic mother,&mdash;while he
openly adhered to the church of his realm, could not avoid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
some exhibitions of coquettish tenderness for the faith of his
slaughtered parent.</p>

<p>But, amid all these changes, there was one class upon
which the wrath of the Church of England and of the Church
of Rome, met in accordant severity;&mdash;this was the Puritan
and ultra Puritan sect,&mdash;to which I have alluded at the commencement
of this discourse,&mdash;whose lot was even more
disastrous under the Protestant Elizabeth, than under the
Catholic Mary. The remorseless courts of her commissioners,
who inquisitorially tried these religionists by interrogation
on oath, imprisoned them, if they remained lawfully
silent and condemned them if they honestly confessed!</p>

<p>A congregation of these sectaries had existed for some
time on the boundaries of Lincoln, Nottingham and York,
under the guidance of Richard Clifton and John Robinson,
the latter of whom was a modest, polished, and learned man.
This christian fold was organized about 1602; but worried by
ceaseless persecution, it fled to Holland, where its members,
fearing they would be absorbed in the country that had entertained
them so hospitably, resolved in 1620 to remove to that
portion of the great American wilderness, known as North
Virginia. Such, in the chronology of our Continent, was the
first decisive emigration of our parent people to the New
World, <i>for the sake of opinion</i>.</p>

<p>It is neither my purpose, nor is it necessary, to sketch the
subsequent history of this New England emigration, or of the
followers, who swelled it into colonial significance.</p>

<p>Its great characteristic, seems to me, to have been, an
unalterable will to worship God according to <i>its</i> own sectarian
ideas, and to afford an equal right and protection to all
who thought as <i>it</i> did, or were willing to conform to its despotic
and anchoritic austerity. It is not very clear, what
were its notions of abstract political liberty; yet there can be
very little doubt what its practical opinions of equality must
have been, when we remember the common dangers, duties,
and interests of such a band of emigrants on the dreary, ice-bound,
savage haunted, coasts of Massachusetts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>may well be asked of a community which for so long a time,
had been the guest of foreigners, and now saw the first great
human and divine law of liberty and equality, taught by the
compulsion of labor and mutual protection, on a strip of land
between the sea and the forest. The colonists were literally
reduced to first principles; they were stripped of the comforts,
pomps, ambitions, distinctions, of the Old World, and
they embraced the common destiny of a hopeful future in
the New.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> They had been persecuted for their opinions, but
that did not make them tolerant of the opinions of their persecutors.
It was better, then, that oppressor and oppressed
should live apart in both hemispheres; and thus, in sincerity,
if not in justice, their future history exhibits many bad examples
of the malign spirit from which they fled in Europe. If
they were, essentially, Republicans, their democracy was limited
to a political and religious equality of Puritan sectarianism;&mdash;it
had not ripened into the democracy of an all
embracing Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p><p>These occurrences took place during the reign of the prince
who united the Scottish and English thrones. At the Court
of James, and in his intimate service, during nearly the whole
period of his sovereignty, was a distinguished personage, who,
though his name does not figure grandly on the page of history,
was deeply interested in the destiny of our continent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir George Calvert</span>, was descended from a noble Flemish
family, which emigrated and settled in the North of England,
where, in 1582, the Founder of Maryland was born.
After taking his Bachelor's degree at Oxford and travelling on
the Continent, he became, at the age of twenty-five, private
Secretary to Sir Robert Cecil, the Lord Treasurer&mdash;afterwards
the celebrated Earl of Salisbury. In 1609, he appears as
one of the patentees named in the new Charter then granted
to the Virginia Company. After the death of his ministerial
patron, he was honored with knighthood and made clerk of
the crown to the Privy Council. This brought him closely to
the side of his sovereign. In 1619, he was appointed one of
the Secretaries of State, and was then, also, elected to Parliament;
first for his native Yorkshire, and subsequently for Oxford.
He continued in office, under James, as Secretary of
State, until near that monarch's death, and resigned in 1624.</p>

<p>Born in the Church of England, Sir George, had, in the
course of his public career, become a Roman Catholic. With
the period or the means of his conversion from the court-faith
to an unpopular creed, we have now no concern. Fuller,
in his "Worthies of England," asserts that Calvert resigned
in consequence of his change of religion;&mdash;other writers,
relying, perhaps, more on the <i>obiter dicta</i> of memoirs and history,
believe that his convictions as to faith had changed some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
years before. Be that, however, as it may, the resignation,
and its alleged cause which was well known to his loving
master, James, produced no ill feeling in that sovereign. He
retired in unpersecuted peace. He was even honored by the
retention of his seat at the Privy Council;&mdash;the King bestowed
a pension for his faithful services;&mdash;regranted him, in fee simple,
lands which he previously held by another tenure; and,
finally, created him Lord Baron of Baltimore, in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Whilst Sir George was in office, his attention, it seems,
had been early directed towards America; and in 1620, he is
still mentioned in a list of the members of the Virginia Company.
Soon after, he became concerned in the plantation of
Newfoundland, and finally, obtained a patent for it, to him
and his heirs, as Absolute Lord and Proprietary, with all the
royalties of a Count Palatine. We must regret that the original,
or a copy of this grant for the province of Avalon, in
Newfoundland, has not been recently seen, or, if discovered,
transmitted to this country.</p>

<p>Here, Sir George built a house; spent &pound;25,000 in improvements;
removed his family to grace the new Principality;
manned ships, at his own charge, to relieve and guard the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
British fisheries from the attacks of the French; but, at length,
after a residence of some years, and an ungrateful return from
the soil and climate, he abandoned his luckless enterprise.</p>

<p>Yet, it was soil and climate alone that disheartened the
Northern adventurer:&mdash;he had not turned his back on America.
In 1629 he repaired to Virginia, in which he had been so
long concerned, and was most ungraciously greeted by the
Protestant royalists, with an offer of the Test-Oaths of Allegiance
and supremacy. Sir George, very properly refused
the challenge, and departed with his followers from the inhospitable
James River, where the bigotry of prelacy denied him
a foothold within the fair region he had partly owned.</p>

<p>But, before he returned to England, he remembered that
Virginia was now a Royal Province and no longer the property
of corporate speculation;&mdash;he recollected that there
were large portions of it still unoccupied by white men, and
that there were bays and rivers, pouring, sea-like, to the
ocean, of which grand reports had come to him when he was
one of the committee of the Council for the affairs of the Plantations.
Accordingly, when he left the James River, he
steered his keel around the protecting peninsula of Old Point
Comfort, and ascending the majestic Chesapeake, entered its
tributary streams, and laid, in imagination, at least, the foundations
of Maryland.</p>

<p>His examination of the region being ended, Calvert went
home to England, and in 1632, obtained the grant of Maryland
from Charles I, the son of his royal patron and friend.
The charter, which is said to have been the composition
of Sir George, did not, however, pass the seals until after
the death of its author; but was issued to his eldest son and
heir, Cecilius, on the 20th of June, 1632. The life of Sir
George had been one of uninterrupted personal and political
success; his family was large, united and happy; if he did
not inherit wealth, he, at least, contrived to secure it; and,
although his conscience taught him to abandon the faith of
his fathers, his avowal of the change had been the signal for
princely favors instead of political persecution.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Here the historic connexion of the <i>first</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Baltimore</span>
with Maryland ends. The real work of Plantation was the
task of <span class="smcap">Cecilius</span>, the first actual Lord Proprietary, and of
<span class="smcap">Leonard Calvert</span>, his brother, to whom, in the following
year, the heir of the family intrusted the original task of colonial
settlement. If anything was done by <span class="smcap">Sir George</span>, in
furtherance of the rights, liberties, or interests of humanity,
so far as the foundation of Maryland is concerned, it was unquestionably
effected anterior to this period, for we have no
authority to say, that after his death, his children were mere
executors of previous designs, or, that what was then done,
was not the result of their own provident liberality. I think
there can be no question that the charter was the work of Sir
George. That, at least, is his property; and he must be
responsible for its defects, as well as entitled to its glory.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>I presume it is hardly necessary for me to say what manner
of person the King was, whom Calvert had served so intimately
during nearly a whole reign. James is precisely the historical
prodigy, to which a reflective mind would suppose the
horrors of his parentage naturally gave birth. In royal chronology
he stands between two axes,&mdash;the one that cleft the
ivory neck of his beautiful mother&mdash;the other that severed the
irresolute but refined head of his son and heir. His father,
doubtless, had been deeply concerned in the shocking murder
of his mother's second husband. Cradled on the throne of
Scotland; educated for Kingship by strangers; the ward of a
regency; the shuttle-cock of ambitious politicians; the hope
and tool of two kingdoms,&mdash;James lived during an age in
which the struggle of opinion and interest, of prerogative and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
privilege, of human right and royal power, of glimmering
science and superstitious quackery, might well have bewildered
an intellect, brighter and calmer than his. The English
people, who were yet in the dawn of free opinions, but who,
with the patience that has always characterized them, were
willing to obey any symbol of order,&mdash;may be said, rather to
have tolerated than honored his pedantry in learning, his kingcraft
in state, his petulance in authority, and his manifold
absurdities, which, while they made him tyrannical, deprived
him of the dignity that sometimes renders even a tyrant respectable.</p>

<p>You will readily believe that a man like George Calvert
found it sometimes difficult to serve such a sovereign, in intimate
state relations. In private life he might not have selected
him for a friend or a companion. But James was his
King; the impersonation of British Royalty and nationality.
In serving him, he was but true to England; and, even in
that task, it, no doubt, often required the whole strength of his
heart's loyalty, to withstand the follies of the royal buffoon.
Calvert, I think, was not an enthusiast, but, emphatically, a
man of his time. His time was not one of Reform, and he
had no brave ambition to be a Reformer. Accustomed to the
routine of an observing and technical official life, he was,
essentially a practical man, and dealt, in politics, exclusively
with the present. Endowed, probably, with but slender imagination,
he found little charm or flavor in excursive abstractions.
His maxim may perhaps have been&mdash;"<i>quieta ne movete,</i>"&mdash;the
motto of moderate or cautions men who live in disturbed
times, preceding or succeeding revolutions, and think
it better&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemblock2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"&mdash;&mdash;to bear those ills we have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Than fly to others that we know not of!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Yet, with all these characteristics, no one will hesitate to believe
that Calvert was a bold and resolute person, when it is
recollected that he visited the wilderness of the New World
in the seventeenth century, and projected therein the formation
of a British Province.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>But, in truth, our materials for his biography are extremely
scant. He died at the very moment when America's chief
interest in him began. He belonged to the Court Party, as
distinguished from the Country Party. He is known to have
been a zealous supporter of the "supremacy of authority." He
held, that "America, having been acquired by conquest, was
subject, exclusively, to the control of royal prerogative." He
was the defender of the Court in its diplomacy; and, ultra as
James was in his monarchical doctrines, there can be little
doubt that he would have dismissed Calvert from office, had
there not been concord between the crown and its servant, as
to the policy, if not the justice, of the toryism they both professed.
But let us not judge that century by the standards of
this. That would be writing history from a false point. Let
us not condemn rulers who seem to be despotic in historic
periods of transition&mdash;in periods of mutual intolerance and distrust&mdash;in
periods when men know nothing, from practical
experience, of the capacity of mankind for self government.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The charter which Sir George Calvert framed, and the successor
of James granted, was precisely the one we might justly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
suppose such a subject, and such a sovereign would prepare
and sign. It invested the Lord Proprietary with all the
royal rights, enjoyed by the Bishop of Durham, within the
County Palatine of Durham. He was the source of justice.
He was the fountain of honor, and allowed to decorate meritorious
provincials with whatever titles and dignities he should
appoint. He had the power to establish feudalism and all its
incidents. He was not merely the founder and filler of office,
but he was also the sole executive. He might erect towns,
boroughs and cities;&mdash;he might pardon offences and command
the forces. As ecclesiastical head of the Province, he had
the right to found churches, and was entitled to their advowsons.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
In certain cases he had the dangerous privilege of
issuing ordinances, which were to have the force of sovereign
decrees. In fact, allegiance to England, was alone preserved,
and the Lord Proprietary became an autocrat, with but two
limitations: 1st, the laws were to be enacted by the Proprietary,
with the advice and approbation of the free men, or free-holders
or their deputies,&mdash;the "<i>liberi homines</i>" and "<i>liberi
tenentes,</i>" spoken of in the charter;&mdash;and 2nd, "no interpretation"
of the charter was "to be made whereby God's Holy
Rights and the true Christian Religion, <i>or</i> the allegiance due
to us," (the King of England,) "our heirs and successors,
may, in any wise, suffer by change, prejudice or diminution."
Christianity and the King&mdash;I blush to unite such discordant
names&mdash;were protected in equal co-partnership.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The first of these reserved privileges of the people, the
Lord Proprietary Cecilius understood, to mean, that <i>he</i> had the
exclusive privilege of proposing laws, and that the free-men,
or free-holders of his province, could only accept or reject his
propositions. These laws of the province were not to be submitted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
to the King for his approval, nor had he the important
<i>right of taxation</i>, which was expressly relinquished. In the
early legislation of Maryland, this supposed exclusive right of
proposing laws by the Proprietary, was soon tested by mutual
rejections, both by the legislative Assembly and by Cecilius,
of the Acts, which each had separately passed or prepared.</p>

<p>But the other clause, touching "God's Holy Rights and
the true Christian Religion," was one, in regard to the practical
interpretation of which, I apprehend, there was never a
moment's doubt in the mind either of the people or of the Proprietary.
It is a radiant gem in the antique setting of the charter.
It is the glory of Calvert. It is the utter obliteration of
prejudice among all who professed Christianity. Toleration
was unknown in the old World; but this was more than toleration,
for it declared freedom at least to <i>Christians</i>,&mdash;yet it
was not perfect freedom, for it excluded that patient and suffering
race&mdash;that chosen people&mdash;who, to the disgrace even
of republican Maryland, within my recollection, were bowed
down by political disabilities.</p>

<p>I am aware that many historians consider the religious freedom
of Maryland as originating in subsequent legislation, and
claim the act of 1649 as the statute of toleration. I do not
agree with them. Sir George Calvert had been a Protestant;&mdash;he
became a Catholic. As a Catholic, he came to Virginia,
and in the colony where he sought to settle, he found himself
assailed, for the first time in his life, by Protestant virulence
and incapacitation. He was now, himself, about to become
a Lord Proprietor. The sovereign who granted his charter
was a Protestant, and moreover, the king of a country whose
established religion was Protestant. The Protestant monarch,
of course, could not <i>grant</i> anything which would compromise
him with his Protestant subjects; yet the Catholic nobleman,
who was to take the beneficiary charter, could not
<i>receive</i>, from his Protestant master, a grant which would assail
the conscience of co-religionists over whom he was, in fact, to
be a sovereign. In England, the King had no right to interfere
with the Church of England; but in America, which was
a vacant, royal domain, his paramount authority permitted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
him to abolish invidious ecclesiastical distinctions. Calvert,
the Catholic, must have been less than a man, if he forgot his
fellow sufferers and their disabilities when he drew his charter.
His Protestant recollections taught him the vexations of
Catholic trials, while his Catholic observation informed him
sharply of Protestant persecution. Sectarianism was already
rampant across the Atlantic.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The two British lodgments, in
Virginia and New England, were obstinately sectarian. Virginia
was Episcopalian; New England was Puritan;&mdash;should
Maryland be founded as an exclusively Protestant province,
or an exclusively Catholic settlement? It is evident that either
would be impossible:&mdash;the latter, because it would have been
both impolitic and probably illegal; and the former because it
would have been a ridiculous anomaly to force a converted
Catholic, to govern a colony wherein his own creed was not
tolerated by a fundamental and unalterable law. It is impossible
to conceive that the faith of Calvert and the legal religion
of Charles, did not enter into their deliberations, when
they discussed the Charter; and, doubtless, both subject and
sovereign justly decided to make "<span class="smcap">The Land of Mary,</span>"
which the Protestant Charles baptised in honor of his Catholic
Queen, a free soil for Christianity. It was Calvert's duly
and interest to make Charles tolerant of Catholic Christianity;
nor could he deny to others the immunity he demanded for
himself and his religious brethren. The language of the
charter, therefore, seems explicit and incapable of any other
meaning. There were multitudes of Catholics in England,
who would be glad to take refuge in a region where they were
to be free from disabilities, and could assert their manhood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
The king, moreover, secured for his Catholic subjects a quiet,
but chartered banishment, which still preserved their allegiance.
At the court there was much leaning towards the
church of Rome. It was rather fashionable to believe one
way, and conform another. The Queen was zealous in her
ancestral faith; and her influence over the king, colored more
than one of his acts. Had Calvert gone to the market place,
and openly proclaimed, that a Protestant king, by a just charter
of neutrality, had established an American sanctuary for
Catholics, and invited them thither under the banner of the
cross, one of his chief objects, must have been at once defeated;
for intolerance would have rallied its parties against the
project, and the dream of benevolence would have been destroyed
for ever. If by the term, "God's Holy Rights and the
true Christian religion," the charter meant, <i>the church of England</i>,
then, <i>ex vi termini</i>, Catholicity could never have been
tolerated in Maryland; and yet it is unquestionable that the
original settlement was made under Catholic auspices&mdash;blessed
by Catholic clergymen&mdash;and acquiesced in by Protestant
followers. Was it not wise, therefore, to shield conscience in
Maryland, under the indefinite but unsectarian phraseology of
"God's Holy Rights and the true Christian Religion?"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>So far, then, for the basis of the charter, and for the action
of Sir George Calvert. After his death, the planting of the
colony took place under the administration of Cecilius, who,
remaining in Europe, dispatched his brother Leonard to
America to carry out his projects.</p>

<p>If the personal history of the Calverts is scant, the history
of the early days of Maryland is scarcely less so; but the industry
of antiquarians, and the researches of a learned Catholic
clergyman, have brought to light two documents which disclose
much of the religious and business character of the settlement.
The work entitled:&mdash;"<span class="smcap">A Relation of Maryland,</span>"
which was published in London in 1635, and gave the first
account of the planting of the province, is a minute, mercantile,
statistical, geographical and descriptive narrative of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
landing and locating of the adventurers who set sail in 1633,
and of their genial intercourse with the aborigines. If I had
time, it would be pleasing to sum up the facts of this historical
treasure, which was evidently prepared under the direction of
Cecilius, Lord Baltimore, if not actually written by him.
It is full of the spirit of careful, honest enterprise; and exhibits,
I think, conclusively, the fact that the design of Calvert,
in establishing this colony, was mainly the creation of a
great estate, manorial and agricultural, whose ample revenues
should, at all times, supply the needs of his ten children and
their descendants.</p>

<p>The other document to which I refer, is a manuscript discovered
some years ago, by the Rev. Mr. McSherry, in the
archives of the college of the Propaganda, at Rome, and exhibits
the zeal with which the worthy Jesuits, whom Lord
Baltimore sent forth with the first settlers, applied themselves
to the christianization of the savages. It presents some beautiful
pictures of the simple life of these devotees. It shows
that, in Maryland, the first step was <i>not</i> made in crime; and
that the earliest duty of the Governor, was not only to conciliate
the Indian proprietors, but to purchase the land they were
willing to resign. Nor was this all; there was provident
care for the soul as well as the soil of the savage. There is
something rare in the watchful forethought which looks not
only to the present gain or future prospects of our fellow men,
which takes heed not only of the personal rights and material
comforts of the race it is displacing, but guards the untutored
savage, and consigns him to the vigilance of instructed
piety. This "<span class="smcap">Narrative of Father White,</span>" and the
Jesuits' letters, preserved in the college at Georgetown, portray
the zeal with which the missionaries, in their frail barks,
thridded the rivers, coves and inlets of our Chesapeake and
Patapsco;&mdash;how they raised the cross, under the shadow of
which the first landing was effected;&mdash;how they set up their
altars in the wigwams of the Indians, and sought, by simplicity,
kindness and reason, to reach and save the Indian. In Maryland,
persecution was dead at the founding;&mdash;prejudice, even,
was forbidden. The cruelties of Spanish planting were unknown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
in our milder clime. No violence was used, to convert
or to appropriate, and thus, the symbol of salvation, was
properly raised on the green Isle of St. Clement, as an emblem
of the peace and good will, which the Proprietary desired
should sanctify his enterprise.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>
<p>I think there ran be no doubt that this adventure had the
double object of affording an exile's refuge to Calvert's co-religionists,
as well as of promoting the welfare of his family.
It was designed for land-holders and laborers. It was a
manorial, planting colony. Its territory was watered by two
bays, several large rivers, and innumerable streams. Its fertile
lands and thick forests, invited husbandmen, while its
capacious coasts tempted the hardy fisherman. And so it is,
that in the Arms which were prepared for the Proprietary government,
the baronial shield of the Calvert family, dropped,
in America, its two supporting leopards, and received in
their stead, on either side, a Fisherman and a Farmer.
"Crescite et Multiplicamini,"&mdash;its motto,&mdash;was a watchword
of provident thrift.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Forty-nine years after the charter was granted to Lord
Baltimore, King Charles II issued a patent, for a magnificent
patrimony in America, to <span class="smcap">William Penn</span>.</p>

<p>But what a change, in that half century, had passed over
the world! A catalogue of the events that took place, in
Great Britain alone, is a history of the growth of Opinion and
of the People.</p>

<p>Charles's efforts to overthrow the Presbyterian Church in
Scotland, and to enforce Episcopacy, brought on the war
with the stern enthusiasts of that country. Laud, in the
Church, and the Earl of Strafford, in the Cabinet, kept the
King in a constant passion of royal and ecclesiastical power.
Strafford fell, and the civil war broke out. Cromwell towered
up suddenly, on the bloody field, and was victorious over the
royalists. The King perished on the scaffold. Cromwell
became Lord Protector. Anon, the commonwealth fell; the
Stuarts were restored, and Charles II ascended the throne;&mdash;but
amid all these perilous acts of political and religious fury,
the world of thought had been stirred by the speeches and
writings, of Taylor, Algernon Sydney, Hampden, and Milton.
As the people gradually felt their power they learned to know
their rights, and, although they went back from Republicanism
to Royalty, they did so, perhaps, only to save themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
from the anarchy that ever threatens a nation while
freeing itself from feudal traditions.</p>

<p>Besides these political and literary phases of the time, there
had been added to the Catholic, Episcopal, and Puritan sects,
a <i>new</i> element of religious power, which was destined to
produce a slow but safe revolution among men.</p>

<p>An humble shoemaker, named <span class="smcap">George Fox</span>, arose and
taught that "every man was complete in himself; he stood in
need of no alien help; the light was free of all control,&mdash;above
all authority external to itself. Each human being, man or
woman, was supreme." The christian denomination called
Quakers, or more descriptively&mdash;"Friends,"&mdash;- thus obtained
a hearing and a standing among all serious persons who
thought Religion a thing of life as well as of death.</p>

<p>Quakerism, with such fundamental principles of equality
in constant practice, became a social polity. If the Quaker
was a Democrat, he was so because the "inner light" of
his christianity made him one, and he dared not disobey
his christianity. He recognized no superiors, for his conscience
taught him to deny any privileges to claimed superiority.
But the Quaker added to his system, an element
which, hitherto, was unknown in the history of sects;&mdash;he was
a Man of Peace. It is not to be supposed that any royal or
ecclesiastical government would allow such radical doctrines
to pass unnoticed, in the midst of a society which was ever
greedy for new teachings. The Quaker, therefore, soon participated
in the persecutions which prelacy thought due to
liberal christianity. But persecution of the Friend, was the
Friend's best publication, for he answered persecution, not by
recantation, but by peaceful endurance. Combative resistance,
in religious differences, always gives the victor a right, or at
least, an excuse, to slay. But Quakerism, a system of personal
and religious independence and peace,&mdash;became slowly successful
by the <i>vis inerti&aelig;</i> of passive resistance. All other
sects were, more or less, combative;&mdash;Quakerism was an
obstinate rock, which stood, in rooted firmness, amid a sea of
strife:&mdash;the billows of faction raged around it and broke on
its granite surface, but they wasted themselves&mdash;<i>not</i> the rock!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
And this is a most important fact in the history of Religion
in its development of society. All other sects lost caste,
power or material, either by aggression or by fighting. But
the Quaker said to the Prelate, the Puritan, and the Catholic,
you may annoy us by public trials, by denial of justice, by
misrepresentation, by imprisonment, by persecution, by the
stake,&mdash;yet we shall stand immovable on two principles,
which deny that God is glorified by warfare&mdash;especially for
opinion. Our principles are, equality and peace&mdash;in the
church and in the world. Equality is to make us humble
and good citizens. Peace is to convert this den of human
tigers into a fold, wherein by simply performing our duties to
each other and to God, we may prepare ourselves for the
world of spirits. You can persecute&mdash;<i>we</i> can suffer. Who
shall tire first? We will be victorious by the firmness that
bears your persecutions; and those very persecutions, while
they publish your shame, shall proclaim our principles as well
as our endurance. They knew, from the history of Charles
1st, that the worst thing to be done with a bad king was to
kill him; for, if the axe metamorphosed that personage into
a martyr, the prison could never extinguish the light of
truth in the doctrines of Quakerism!<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>You will pardon me, gentlemen, for having detained you so
long in discussing the foundation of Maryland. The planting
of your own state is familiar to you. It has been thoroughly
treated in the writings of your Proud, Watson, Gordon,
Du Ponceau, Tyson, Fisher, Wharton, Reed, Ingraham, Armstrong
and many others. Can it be necessary for me to say
a word, in Philadelphia, of the history of <span class="smcap">William Penn</span>;&mdash;of
him, who, as a lawgiver and executive magistrate,&mdash;a
practical, pious, Quaker,&mdash;<i>first</i> developed in state affairs, and
reduced to practice, the liberty and equality enjoined by his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
religion and founded on liberal christianity;&mdash;of him who
<i>first</i> taught mankind the sublime truth, that&mdash;</p>

<p>It would be idle to detail the facts of his life or government,
for, not only have Pennsylvanians recorded and dwelt upon
them until they are household lessons, but they have been
favorite themes for French, British, Italian, German and
Spanish philosophers and historians.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was Penn to whom the charter of 1681 was granted,
half a century after the patent issued to Cecilius Calvert.
The instrument itself, has many of the features of the Maryland
grant; but it is well known that the absolute powers it
bestowed on the Proprietary, were only taken by him in order
that he might do as he pleased in the formation of a new
state, whose principles of freedom and peace, might, first in
the World's history, practically assume a national aspect.</p>

<p>I shall not recount the democratic liberalities of his system,
as it was matured by his personal efforts and advice. Original,
as he unquestionably was, in genius; bold as he was in
resisting the pomp of the world, at a time when its vanities
sink easiest and most corruptingly into the heart,&mdash;we may
nevertheless, say, that the deeds and history of his time, as
well as of the previous fifty years, had a large share in
moulding his character.</p>

<p>In William Penn, the crude germs of religious originality,
which, in Fox, were struggling, and sometimes almost stifling
for utterance, found their first, ablest, and most accomplished
expounder. He gave them refinement and respectability.
His intimacy with Algernon Sidney taught him the value of
introducing those principles into the doctrines of government;&mdash;and
thus, he soon learned that when political rights
grow into the sanctity of religious duties, they receive thereby<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
a vitality which makes them irresistible. Penn, in this wise,
become an expanded embodiment of Fox and Sidney; and,
appropriating their mingled faith and polity, discarded every
thing that was doctrinal and not practical, and realized, in
government, their united wisdom. Nobly <i>in his age</i>, did he
declare: "I know what is said by the several admirers of
monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, which are the rule
of one, of a few, and of the many, and are the three common
ideas of government when men discourse on that subject.
But I choose to solve the controversy with this small distinction,
and it belongs to all three:&mdash;<i>any government is free to
the people under it, whatever be the frame, where the laws
rule and the people are a party to those laws; and more than
this is tyranny, oligarchy, and confusion.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>In these historical illustrations, I have striven to show that
Primitive Christianity was the basis of equal rights and responsibilities.
The alleged defence of this christianity, in the
land of its birth, gave rise to "holy wars," in which Feudalism
and Chivalry originated. Feudalism was the source of
the strictest military dependence, as well as of manifold social
perversions. The knight expanded into a lord,&mdash;the subject
commoner dwindled to a soldier or a serf. Thus Feudalism
and a great historical Church, grew up in aristocratic co-partnership
over the bodies and souls of mankind, until the one,
by the omnipotence of its spiritual authority, ripened into an
universal hierarchy, while the other, by the folly of its "divine
right," decayed into a temporal despotism that fell at the first
blow of the heads-man's axe. The reformation and revolution
broke the enchanter's wand; and, when the cloud passed
from the bloody stage, instead of seeing before us a magician
full of the glories of his art and almost deceived himself, by
the splendor of his incantations, we beheld a meagre and
pitiful creature, who though blind and palsied, still retained
for a while, the power of witch-like mischief. But his reign
was not lasting. The stern Puritan,&mdash;the pioneer of Independence,&mdash;advanced
with his remorseless weapon,&mdash;while
quietly, in his shadow, followed the calm and patient Friend,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
sowing the seed of Peace and Good-Will in the furrows
plowed by the steel of his unrelenting predecessor. And
thus again, after ages of corrupt and desolating perversion,
the selfish heart of man came humbly back to its original faith
that Liberal Christianity is the true basis of enlightened freedom,
and the only foundation of good and lasting government.</p>

<p>Calvert, a protestant officer of the crown, became a catholic,
and, retiring to private life, was rewarded by his king,
with a pension, estates, and an American principality;&mdash;Penn,
the son of a British Admiral, and who is only accurately
known to us by a portrait which represents him <i>in armor</i>, began
life as an adherent of the Church of England, and having
conscientiously, doffed the steel for the simple garb of Quakerism,
was persecuted, not only by his government but his
parent. Calvert took the grant of a feudal charter, and
asserting all its legislative and baronial powers, sought to fasten
its Chinese influence, in feudal fixedness, on his colonists;&mdash;but
Penn, knowing that feudalism was an absurdity,
in the necessary equality of a wilderness, embraced his great
authority in order "to leave himself and his successors no
power of doing mischief, so that the will of one man might
not hinder the good of a whole community."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p><p>Calvert seems to have thought of English or Irish emigration
alone;&mdash;Penn, did not confine himself to race, but
sought for support from the Continent as well as from Britain.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Calvert was ennobled for his services;&mdash;Penn rejected a
birthright which might have raised him to the peerage.</p>

<p>Calvert's public life was antecedent to his American visit&mdash;Penn's
was almost entirely subsequent to the inception of his
"holy experiment."</p>

<p>Calvert laid the foundations of a mimic kingdom;&mdash;Penn,
with the power of a prince, stripped himself of authority.
The one was naturally an aristocrat of James's time; the
other, quite as naturally, a democrat of the transition age of
Sidney.</p>

<p>Calvert imagined that mankind stood still; but, Penn believed,
that mankind <i>ever</i> moves, or, that like an army under
arms, when not marching, it is marking time.</p>

<p>While to Calvert is due the honor of a considerable religious
advance on his age, as developed in his charter,&mdash;Penn is to
be revered for the double glory of civil and <i>perfect</i> religious
liberty. Calvert mitigated man's lot by toleration;&mdash;Penn
expanded the germ of toleration into unconditional freedom.</p>

<p>Calvert was the founder of a Planting Province, mainly
agricultural, and creative of all the manorial dependencies;&mdash;but
Penn seems to have heartily cherished the idea of a great
City, and of the commerce it was to gather and develope
from a wilderness over which it was to stand as guardian
sentinel. As farming was the chief interest of the one, trading,
became, also, a favorite of the other; and thus, while
the <i>transient</i> trader visited, supplied, and left the native
Indian free,&mdash;the <i>permanent</i> planter settled forever on his
"hunting grounds," and drove him further into the forest.</p>

<p>Calvert recognized the law of war;&mdash;Penn made peace a
fundamental institution. They both felt that civilized nations
have a double and concurrent life,&mdash;material and spiritual;&mdash;but
Calvert sought rather to develop one, while Penn addressed
himself to the care of both.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>
<p>Calvert's idea was to open a new land by old doctrines,
and to form his preserving amber around a worthless fly;&mdash;but
Penn's Pennsylvania was to crystalize around the novel
and lucid nucleus of freedom.</p>

<p>Calvert supposed that America was to be a mere reflex of
Britain, and that the heart of his native Island would pulsate
here; but Penn, seeing that the future population of
America, like the soil of the Mississippi Valley, would be an
alluvial deposit from the overflow of European civilization,
thought it right to plant a new doctrine of human rights,
which would grow more vigorously for its transplanting and
culture.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The germs of Civil and Religious freedom may be found
elsewhere in the foundation of American provinces and colonies.
I know they are claimed for the cabin of the Mayflower,
the rock of Plymouth, and the sands of Rhode Island.
But I think that William Penn is justly entitled to the honor
of adopting them on principle, after long and patient reflection,
as the seed of his people, and thus, of having taken from their
introduction by him into this country, all the disparagement
of originating either in discontent or accident. His plan was
the offspring of beautiful design, and not the gypsey child of
chance or circumstance.</p>

<p>History is to man what water is to the landscape,&mdash;it mirrors,
but distorts in its reflection, and the great founder of
Pennsylvania has suffered from this temporary distortion.
But, at length, the water will become still, and the image will
be perfect. Penn is one of those majestic figures that loom
up on the waste of time, in the same eternal permanence and
simple grandeur in which the Pyramids rise in relief from the
sands of Egypt. Let no Arab displace a single stone!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be noticed that this <i>Latin</i> copy, according to the well known ancient
usage in such papers, is not punctuated, so that we have no guidance, for the
purpose of translation, from that source.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>The translation of this section as far as the words: "<i>Proviso semper quod
nulla fiat interpretatio,</i>" &amp;c. is sufficiently correct; but the whole of the final
clause, should in my opinion, be rendered thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Provided always that no interpretation thereof be made, whereby <span class="smcap">God's
holy rights</span> <i>and</i> the <span class="smcap">TRUE CHRISTIAN RELIGION</span>, or the allegiance due to
us our heirs or successors, may, in any wise suffer by change, prejudice or
diminution." Let me offer my reasons for this alteration:</p>

<p>1st, This new translation harmonizes with the evident grammatical construction
of the Latin sentence, and is the easiest as well as most natural.
The common version, given by Bacon: "<span class="smcap">God's</span> holy <i>and</i> true <span class="smcap">CHRISTIAN</span>
religion,"&mdash;is grossly pleonastic, if not nonsensical. Among christians, "God's
religion," can of course, only be the "christian religion;" and, with equal
certainty, it is not only a "true" religion, but a "holy" one!</p>

<p>2nd, The word <i>Sacrosanctus</i>, always conveys the idea of a <i>consecrated inviolability,
in consequence of inherent rights and privileges</i>. In a dictionary, <i>contemporary
with the charter</i>, I find the following definition,&mdash;<i>in verbo sacrosanctus.</i></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sacrosanctus</span>: Apud Ciceronem dicebatur id quod interposito jurejurando
sanctum, et institutum erat idem etiam significat ac sanctus, <i>santo</i>.
<i>Tribunus plebis dicebatur sacrosanctus, quia eum nefas erat attingere, long&egrave;
diviniori ratione Catholici appellamus ecclesiam Romanam sacrosanctam.</i> Calpinus
Parvus;&mdash;seu Dictionarium C&aelig;saris Calderini Mirani: <i>Venetiis</i>, 1618.</p>

<p>Cicero, <i>in Catil</i>: 2. 8.&mdash;uses the phrase&mdash;"Possessiones sacrosanct&aelig;," in this
sense; and so does Livy in the epithet,&mdash;"Sacrosancta potestas," as applied to
the Tribuneship; and, in the sentence,&mdash;"ut plebi sui magistratus essent sacrosanct&aelig;."</p>

<p>From the last sentence, in the definition given in the Venetian Dictionary of
1618, which I have cited in italics, it will be seen that the epithet had a peculiarly
Catholic signification <i>in its appropriation</i> by the Roman Church.</p>

<p>3d, I contend that "<i>sacrosancta</i>" does not qualify "<i>religio</i>," but agrees with
<i>negotia</i>, or some word of similar import, understood; and thus the phrase&mdash;"<i>sacrosancta
Dei</i>"&mdash;forms a distinct branch of the sentence.</p>

<p>If the translation given in Bacon is the true one, the positions of the words
"sacrosancta" and "Dei" should be reversed, for their present collocation clearly
violates accurate Latin construction. In that case, "<i>Dei</i>" being subject to the
government of "<i>religio</i>," ought to precede "<i>sacrosancta</i>," which would be appurtenant
to "<i>religio</i>," while "<i>et</i>," which would then couple the two adjectives
instead of the two members of the sentence, should be placed immediately between
them, without the interposition of any word to disunite it either from
"<i>sacrosancta</i>" or "<i>vera</i>." If my translation be correct, then the collocation of
all the words in the original Latin of the charter, is proper. If "<i>sacrosancta</i>"
is a neuter adjective agreeing with "<i>negotia</i>," understood,&mdash;and "<i>et</i>" conjoins
members of sentences, then the whole clause is obedient to a positive law of
Latin verbal arrangement. Leverett says: "The genitive is elegantly put before
the noun which governs it with one or more words between; <i>except</i> when
the genitive is <i>governed by a neuter adjective</i>, in which case, <i>it must</i> be <i>placed
after it</i>."</p>

<p>4th, Again:&mdash;if "<i>et</i>" joins "<i>sacrosancta</i>" and "<i>vera</i>," which, thereby, qualify
the same noun, there are <i>then</i> only two nominatives in the Latin sentence of
the charter, viz: "<i>religio</i>" and "<i>ligcantia</i>." Now these nouns, being coupled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
by the disjunctive conjunction "<i>aut</i>," must have the verb agreeing with them
<i>separately</i> in the singular. But, as "<i>patiantur</i>" happens to be in the plural, the
author of the charter must either have been ignorant of one of the simplest
grammar rules, or have designed to convey the meaning I contend for.</p>

<p>I must acknowledge the aid and confirmation I have received, in examining
this matter, from the very competent scholarship of my friend Mr. Knott,
assistant Librarian of the Maryland Historical Society.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_No_II" id="APPENDIX_No_II"></a>APPENDIX No. II.</h2>


<p>The scope of my discourse is confined to the illustration of <i>principles</i> either
announced, or acted on, in the <i>founding</i> of Maryland and Pennsylvania. I
have contended that Sir George Calvert, the <i>first</i> Lord Baltimore, so framed
the charter which was granted by Charles I, that, without express concessions,
the general character of its language in regard to religious rights, would secure
liberty of conscience to christians.</p>

<p>I: 1632.&mdash;Language can scarcely be more perspicuously comprehensive,
than in the phrase: "God's Holy Rights and the true Christian Religion."
Under such a clause, <i>in the charter</i>, no particular church could set up a claim
for its exclusive christianity. There was no mention, in the instrument, of
"the Established Church," or, of "the Church of England." The Catholic
could not deny the Episcopalian's christianity; the Episcopalian could not
deny the Catholic's, nor could the Puritan question the christianity of either.
All professed faith in Christ. Each of the three great sects might contend that
its <i>form</i> of worship, or interpretation of the Bible, was the correct one; but
all came lawfully under the great generic class of christians. And, while the
political government of the colonists was to be conducted by a Catholic magistrate,
in a province belonging to a Catholic Lord,&mdash;the <i>interpretation</i> of the law
of religious rights was to be made, not by the laws of England, but exclusively
under the paramount law of the provincial charter. By that document the
broad "rights of God," and "the true christian religion," could not "suffer by
change, prejudice or diminution."</p>

<p>This view is strengthened by a clause in the 4th section of the charter, by
which the king granted Lord B. "the patronages and advowsons of <span class="smcap">ALL</span> <i>churches</i>
which, <i>with the increasing worship and</i> <span class="smcap">Religion of Christ</span>, (<i>crescenti Christi
cultu et religione,</i>") should be built within his province. The right of <i>advowson</i>,
being thus bestowed on the Lord Proprietary, for <i>all Christian Churches</i>;
his majesty, then, goes on, empowering Lord B. to erect and found churches,
chapels, &amp;c. and <i>to cause</i> them to be dedicated "<i>according to the Ecclesiastical
laws of our kingdom of England</i>." The general right of advowson, and the particular
privilege, conceded to a Catholic, of causing the consecration of Episcopal
churches, are <i>separate</i> powers and ought not to be confounded by a hasty
reader of the charter.</p>

<p>I think there can hardly be a fair doubt that the interpretation I give to the
22nd clause is the one assigned to it by the immigrants from the earliest colonial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
movement in 1633. We may assert, therefore, the fact, that religious freedom
was offered and secured for christians, in the province of Maryland, from the
very beginning.</p>

<p>II: 1633.&mdash;We must recollect that under the English statutes, <i>adherents of
the national church required no protection</i>; they were free in the exercise of their
faith; but Catholics and Puritans were not so happily situated, and, accordingly,
they sought, in the new world an exemption from the disabilities and
persecutions they experienced at home. Can it be credited, that, under such
vexations, the Catholic Lord Baltimore would have drawn a charter, or, his
Catholic son and successor, sent forth a colony, under a Catholic Governor,
when the fundamental law, under which alone he exercised his power, did not
secure liberty to him and his co-religionists? It is simply necessary to ask the
question, in order to demonstrate the absurdity of such a supposition.</p>

<p>III: 1634.&mdash;If we show, then, that Catholic conscience was untrammeled in
Maryland, I think we may fairly assume the general ground as satisfactorily
proved. What was, briefly, the first movement of this sect, under the Lord
Proprietary's auspices? When Lord C&aelig;cilius was planning his colonial expedition
in 1633, one of his earliest cares was to apply to the Order of Jesus for
clergymen to attend the Catholic planters and settlers, and to convert the natives.
Accordingly, under the sanction of the Superior, Father White joined
the emigrants, <i>although, under previous persecutions in England, he had been
sent into perpetual banishment, to return from which subjected the culprit to the
penalty of death</i>! These facts are set forth, at page 14 of the 2nd volume of
Challoner's Memoirs. Historia Anglo-Bavara, S. J. Rev. Dr. Oliver's collections
illustrative of the Scotch, English and Irish Jesuits, page 222, and in
the essay on the Early Maryland Missions, by Mr. B. U. Campbell. Fathers
Andrew White and John Altham, and two lay brothers, named John Knowles
and Thomas Gervase, accompanied the first expedition, and were active agents
in consecrating the possession of the soil, and converting <i>Protestant immigrants</i>
as well as heathen natives. The colony, therefore, cannot properly be called a
Protestant one, when its <i>only</i> spiritual guides were Catholics; and consequently
if it was more of a Catholic than a Protestant emigration, it must, by legal
necessity, have been free from the moment it quitted the shores of England.
If the Catholic was free, all were free.</p>

<p>IV: 1637.&mdash;Our next authority, in regard to the <i>early interpretation</i> of religious
rights in Maryland, is found in a passage in Chalmers's Political Annals,
page 235. "In the oath," says he, "taken by the Governor and Council,
<i>between</i> the years 1637 and 1657, there was the following clause, which ought
to be administered to the rulers of every country. 'I will not, by myself or any
other, directly or indirectly, trouble, molest or discountenance, any person professing
to believe in Jesus Christ, for or on account of his religion.'" This
shows, that "belief in Jesus Christ," under the constitutional guaranty of the
charter, anterior to the enactment of any colonial law by the Maryland Assembly,
secured sects from persecution. The language of the oath, which was
doubtless promulgated by the Lord Proprietor, is as broad as the language of
the charter. The statement of Chalmers has been held to be indefinite as to
whether the oath was taken <i>from</i> 1637 to 1657, or, whether it was taken in
some years <i>between</i> those dates; but, if the historian did not mean to say that
it had been administered <i>first</i> in 1637, and continued afterwards, why would he
not have specified any other, as the beginning year, as well as 1637? The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
objection seems rather hypercritical than plausible. Chalmers was too accurate
a writer to use dates so loosely, and inasmuch as he was an old Maryland
lawyer and custodian of the Maryland provincial papers, he had the best opportunity
to designate the precise date. A Governor's oath was a regular and
necessary official act. No one can doubt that an oath was required of that
personage in Maryland; and the oath in question, is precisely such an one as
Protestant settlers, in that age, might naturally expect from a Catholic Magistrate,
who, (even from motives of the humblest policy,) would be willing to
grant to others what he was anxious to secure for himself. If ever there was
a proper time for perfect toleration, it was at this moment, when a Catholic
became, <i>for the first time in history</i>, a sovereign prince of the <i>first province</i> of
the British Empire!</p>

<p>Mr. Chalmers could not have confounded the oath whose language he cites,
with other oaths which the reader will find cited in the 2nd volume of Bozman's
History of Maryland, at pages 141, 608, 642. The oath prepared for
Stone in 1648, appears to have been an augmented edition of the one quoted
by Chalmers, and is so different in parts of its phraseology as well as items,
that it cannot have been mistaken by the learned annalist. Bancroft,
McMahon, Tyson, C. F. Mayer and B. U. Campbell, adopt his statement as
true.</p>

<p>V: 1638.&mdash;In regard to the early <i>practice of Maryland</i> tribunals, on the subject
of tolerance, we have a striking case in 1638. In that year a certain
<i>Catholic</i>, named William Lewis, was arraigned before the Governor, Secretary,
&amp;c., for <i>abusive language to Protestants</i>. Lewis confessed, that, coming into a
room where Francis Gray and Robert Sedgrave, servants of Captain Cornwaleys,
were reading, he heard them recite passages so that he should hear them,
that were reproachful to his religion, "viz: that the Pope was anti-Christ,
and the Jesuits anti-Christian Ministers, &amp;c: he told them it was a falsehood
and came from the devil, and that he that writ it was an instrument of the
devil, and so he would approve it!" The court found the culprit "guilty of
a very offensive speech in calling the Protestant ministers, the ministers of
the devil," and of "exceeding his rights, in forbidding them to read a lawful
book." In consequence of this "offensive language," and other "unreasonable
disputations, in point of religion, tending to the disturbance of the
peace and quiet of the Colony, committed by him, <i>against a public proclamation
set forth to prohibit all such disputes</i>," Lewis was fined and remanded
into custody until he gave security for future good behaviour.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Thus, four years, only, after the settlement, the liberty of conscience was
vindicated by a recorded judicial sentence, and "unreasonable disputations in
point of religion," rebuked by a Catholic Governor in the person of a Catholic
offender. There could scarcely be a clearer evidence of impartial and tolerant
sincerity. The decision, moreover, is confirmatory of the fact that the Governor
had taken such an oath as Chalmers cites, in the previous year, 1637; especially
as there had <i>already been a "proclamation to prohibit disputes</i>!"</p>

<p>VI: 1638.&mdash;At the <i>first efficient</i> General Assembly of the Colony, which
was held in this year, only two Acts were passed, though thirty-six other bills
were twice read and engrossed, but not finally ripened into laws. The second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
of the two acts that were passed, contains a section asserting that "Holy
Church, <i>within this province</i>, shall have all her rights and liberties;" thus securing
the rights of Catholics;&mdash;while the first of the thirty-six incomplete
acts was one, which we know only by <i>title</i>, as "An act for <i>Church liberties</i>."
It was to continue in force until the end of the next General Assembly, and
then, with the Lord Proprietary's consent, to be perpetual. Although we
have no means of knowing the extent of the proposed "Church liberties," we
may suppose that the proposed enactment was general, in regard to all Christian
sects besides the Catholics.</p>

<p>VII: 1640.&mdash;At the session of 1640, an act for "Church liberties" <i>was passed</i>
on the 23d October, and confirmed, as a perpetual law, in the first year of the
accession of Charles Calvert, 3d Lord Baltimore, in 1676. This Act also
declares that "Holy Church, within this province, shall have and enjoy all
her rights, liberties and franchises, wholly and without blemish." Thus, in
1640, legislation had already settled opinion as to the rights of Catholics and
Protestants. Instead of the early Catholics seeking to contract the freedom of
other sects, their chief aim and interest seem to have been to secure their own.
I consider the Acts I have cited rather as mere declaratory statutes, than as
necessary original laws.</p>

<p>VIII: 1649.&mdash;In this year, an assembly, believed to have been composed of
a Protestant majority, passed the act which has been lauded as the source of
religious toleration. It is "An Act concerning Religion," and, in my judgment,
is less tolerant than the Charter or the Governor's Oath, inasmuch as it
included Unitarians in the same category with blasphemers and those who
denied our Saviour Jesus Christ, punishing all alike, with confiscation of
goods and the pains of <i>death</i>. This was the epoch of the trial and execution
of Charles I, and of the establishment of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>IX: 1654.&mdash;The celebrated act I have just noticed, however, was passed
fifteen years after the original settlement, which exceeds the period comprised
in the actual <i>founding</i> of Maryland. Besides this, the political and religious
aspect of England was changing, and the influence of the home-quarrel was
beginning to be felt across the Atlantic. In 1654, during the mastery of
Cromwell, religious freedom was destroyed: Puritanism became paramount;
Papacy and Prelacy were denounced by law; and freedom was assured only
to Puritans, and such as professed "faith in God by Jesus Christ, though differing
in judgment, from the doctrine or worship publicly held forth."</p>

<p>X.&mdash;It has been alleged that the clause in the Maryland Charter securing
"God's holy rights and the true Christian religion," is only an incorporation
into Lord Baltimore's instrument, of certain clauses contained in the early
Charters of Virginia. If the reader will refer to the 1st volume of Henning's
Statutes at large, he will find all those documents in English, but <i>unaccompanied
by the original Latin</i>. Thus, we have no means of judging the <i>accuracy
of the translation</i>, or <i>identity of language</i> in the Maryland and Virginia instruments.
Adopting, however, for the present, the translation given by Henning,
we find no coincidence of phraseology either to justify the suspicion of a mere
copy, or to subject our charter to the <i>limitations</i> contained in the Virginia
patents. Disabilities are to be construed strictly in law, and our charter is not
to be interpreted by another, but stands on its own, independent, context and
manifest signification.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>The first Virginia Charter or Patent was issued to Sir Thomas Gates and
others, April 10th, 1606, in the 4th year of James's English reign. Among
the "Articles, Orders, Instructions," &amp;c., set down for Virginia, 20th Nov.,
1606,&mdash;(though nothing is said about restrictions in religion, while the preamble
commends the noble work of propagating the Christian religion among
infidel savages,)&mdash;is the following clause:&mdash;"And we doe specallie ordaine,
charge, and require the presidents and councills," (of the two Colonies of
Virginia,) "respectively, within their severall limits and precincts, that they
with all diligence, care and respect, doe provide, that the <i>true word and service
of God and Christian faith</i>, be preached, planted and used, not only within
every of the said severall colonies and plantations, but alsoe, as much as they
may, among the salvage people which doe or shall adjoine unto them, or border
upon them, <i>according to the</i> <span class="smcap">DOCTRINE</span>, <span class="smcap">RIGHTS</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">RELIGION</span>, <i>now professed
and established within our realme of England</i>."&mdash;<i>1st Henning</i>, 69.</p>

<p>The second charter or patent, dated 23d May, 1609, 7th "James I," was
issued to the Treasurer and Company for Virginia, and in its XXIX section,
declares: "And lastly, because the principal effect, which we can desire or
expect of this action, is the conversion and reduction of the people in those
parts unto the <i>Worship of God and Christian religion, in which respect we should
be loath, that any person be permitted to pass, that we suspected to affect the superstitions
of the Church of Rome</i>; we do hereby declare that it is our will and
pleasure that none be permitted to pass in any voyage, from time to time, to
be made unto the said country, but such as shall first have taken the Oath of
Supremacy; &amp;c., &amp;c.&mdash;<i>1st Henning</i>, 97.</p>

<p>The third Charter of James the I, in the 9th year of his English reign, was
issued 12th March, 1611-12 to the Treasurer and Company for Virginia. The
XIIth section empowers certain officers to administer the <i>Oath of Supremacy
and Allegiance</i>, to "all and every persons which shall at any time or times
hereafter go or pass to said Colony of Virginia."</p>

<p>The Instructions to Governor Wyatt, of 24th of July, 1621, direct him:&mdash;"<i>to
keep up the Religion of the Church of England, as near as may be</i>," &amp;c.,
&amp;c.&mdash;<i>1st Henning.</i></p>

<p>All these extracts, it will be observed, contain <i>limitations</i> and <i>restrictions</i>,
either explicitly <i>in favor</i> of the English Church, or <i>against</i> the, so called, "superstitions
of the Church of Rome." The Maryland Charter shows no such
narrow clauses, and consequently, is justly free from any connexion, <i>in interpretation</i>,
with the Virginia instruments. Besides this, we do not know that
the language of the original Latin of the Virginia Charters, is the same as ours,
and, therefore, it would be "reasoning in a circle," or, "begging the question,"
if we translated the Maryland Charter into the exact language of the Virginian.
The phraseology&mdash;"God's holy rights and the true Christian religion,"&mdash;<i>unlimited
in the Maryland Patent</i>,&mdash;was a distinct assertion of broad equality
to all professing to believe in Jesus Christ. It was not subject to any sectarian
restriction, and formed the basis of religious liberty in Maryland, until it was
undermined during the Puritan intolerance in 1654.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

fears of the Spaniard, even at that early time, conjured up the warning
phantom of Anglo-Saxon "<i>annexation.</i>"</p>

<p>"It is well known," says the pamphlet, "that our English plantations have
had little countenance; nay, that our statesmen, (when time was,) had store
of Gundemore's gold," (meaning Gondomar, Spanish Minister at James's
Court)&mdash;"<i>to destroy</i> and discountenance the plantation of Virginia; and he
effected it, in great part, by dissolving the company, wherein most of the
nobility, gentry, corporate cities, and most merchants of England, were
interested and engaged; after the expense of some hundred of thousands of
pounds; for Gundemore did affirm to his friends, that he had commission from
his master"&mdash;(the King of Spain,)&mdash;"to destroy that plantation. For, said
he, should they thrive and go on increasing, as they have done under that
popular Lord of Southampton, <i>my master's West Indies</i>, <span class="smcap">and his Mexico</span>,
<i>would shortly be visited by sea and by land, from those Planters in Virginia</i>."
</p>
<p>Generals Scott and Taylor&mdash;both sons of Virginia&mdash;have verified, in the
nineteenth century, the foresight of the cautious statesman of the seventeenth.

intolerance, and martyrs, as they supposed, to the cause of religious freedom,
practiced the same intolerance to those who were so unfortunate as to differ
from them. In 1635, Roger Williams was banished from the Massachusetts
colony for differences of religious opinions with the civil powers. This was
the next year after the arrival of the Maryland colony. In 1659, fifteen years
later, a Baptist received thirty lashes at the whipping post, in Boston, for his
peculiar faith; and nine years later, three persons suffered death by the common
hangman, in the same place, for their adherence to the sect of Quakers."&mdash;<i>Rev.

On the 13th Sept. 1644, these N. England Puritans, passed a law of banishment
against Anabaptists; in 1646, another law, imposing the same punishment,
was passed against Heresy and Error; in 1647, the order of Jesuits came
in for a share of intolerance;&mdash;its members were inhibited from entering the
colony; if they came in, heedless of the law, they were to be banished, and if
they returned after banishment, they were to be <i>put to death</i>. On the 14th of
October 1656, the celebrated law was enacted against "the cursed sect of heretics
lately risen up in the world, which are commonly called Quakers:"&mdash;by its
decrees, captains of vessels who introduced these religionists, knowingly, were
to be fined or imprisoned; "quaker books or writings containing their devilish
opinions," were not to be brought into the colony, under a penalty; while quakers
who came in, were to be committed to the house of correction, kept constantly
at work, not allowed to speak, and severely whipped, on their entrance
into this sanctuary!&mdash;See original Acts, <i>Hazard's His. Coll. 1, pp. 538, 545,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> See Mr. John P. Kennedy's discourse on the life and character of Sir George
Calvert, and the reviews thereof, with Mr K's reply, on this question of religion,
in the U. S. Catholic Magazine, 1846. Since the publication of Mr.
Kennedy's discourse and the reviews of it, in 1846, I have met with an English
work published in London in 1839, <i>attributed</i> to Bishop Goodman, entitled an
"Account of the Court of James the first." In vol. 1, p. 376, he says: "The
third man who was thought to gain by the Spanish match was Secretary Calvert;
and as he was the <i>only Secretary employed in the Spanish match</i>, so undoubtedly
he did what good offices he could therein, for religion's sake, <i>being
infinitely addicted to the Roman Catholic faith, having been converted thereto by
Count Gondemar and Count Arundel, whose daughter Secretary Calvert's Son
had married; and, as it was said, the Secretary did usually catechise his own
children, so to ground them in his own religion; and in his best room having an
altar set up, with chalice, candlesticks, and all other ornaments, he brought all
strangers thither, never concealing anything, as if his whole joy and comfort had
been to make open profession of his religion</i>." As the Prelate was a <i>contemporary</i>,
this statement, founded, as it may be, on report, is of considerable importance.
Fuller, also, was a contemporary though thirty years younger than
Calvert. The Spanish match, alluded to, was on the carpet as early as 1617,
and was broken off in the beginning of 1624. It was probably during this
period that Lord Arundel and the Spanish Minister influenced the mind of Sir
George as to religion.</p></div>

that the charter of Maryland was a <i>literal copy</i> from the prior patent of Avalon;
but of this we are unable to judge, as he neither cites his authority nor indicates
the depository of the Avalon Charter. If the Maryland charter is an <i>exact</i>
transcript of the Avalon document, it is interesting to know the fact, as Calvert
may have been a Protestant, when the latter was issued. Bozman states
an authority for its date, as of 1623, which would indicate that this document
may still probably be found in the British Museum. If it was issued in 1623,
it was granted a year before, Fuller says, Calvert resigned because he had become
a Catholic. In all likelihood, however, Sir George was not converted in
a day!&mdash;<i>See Bozman Hist. Maryland ed. 1837, vol. 1 p. 240 et seq. in note.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> The Baron Von Raumer, in his Hist. of the XVI and XVII Centuries, vol.
2, p. 263, quoting from Tillieres, says of Calvert: "He is an honorable, sensible
well-minded man, courteous towards strangers, full of respect towards embassadors,
zealously intent on the welfare of England; but by reason of all these
good qualities, entirely without consideration or influence."

The only original work or tract by which we know the character of Sir
George Calvert's mind is "<span class="smcap">The Answer to Tom Tell-Troth, the Practise
of Princes and the Lamentations of the Kirke</span>, <i>written by Lord
Baltimore, late Secretary of State</i>." London, <i>printed 1642</i>:&mdash;a copy of which, in
MS., is in the collections of the Maryland Hist. Soc. This is a quaint specimen
of pedantic politics and toryism&mdash;larded with Latin quotations, and altogether
redolent of James's Court. It was addressed to Charles I, and shows
the author's intimate acquaintance with the political history and movements of
the continental powers. We may judge Calvert's politics by the following passage
in which he <i>commends</i> the doctrines of his old master:&mdash;
</p><p>
"King James," says he, "in his oration to the Parliament, 1620, used these
words <i>very judiciattie</i>; Kings and Kingdoms were before Parliaments; the
Parliament was never called for the purpose to meddle with complaints against
the King, the Church, or State matters, but <i>ad consultandum de rebus arduis,
Nos et Regnum nostrum concernantibus</i>; as the writ will inform you. I was
never the cause, nor guiltie of the election of my sonne by the Bohemians,
neither would I be content that any other king should dispute whether I am
a lawful King or no, and to tosse crowns like Tennis-balls."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> It may seem strange, that, being a Catholic, he still had the right of advowson
or of presentation to Protestant Episcopal Churches; but it was not until
the Act of 1st William and Mary, chapter 26, that Parliament interfered with
the right of Catholics to present to religious benefices. That Act vested the
presentations belonging to Catholics in the Universities. An Act passed 12th
Anne, was of a similar disabling character.&mdash;<i>Butler's Hist. Mem. vol. 3, pp.

with Marylanders in Massachusetts in 1631. "The Dove," one of the vessels
of the first colonists to Maryland, was dispatched to Massachusetts with a
cargo of corn to exchange for fish. She carried a friendly letter from Calvert
and another from Harvey, but the magistrates were suspicious of a people who
"<i>did set up mass openly</i>." Some of the crew were accused of reviling the inhabitants
of Massachusetts as "holy brethren," "the members," &amp;c., and just
as the ship was about to sail; <i>the supercargo, happening on shore, was arrested in
order to compel the master to give up the culprits</i>. The proof failed, and the
vessel was suffered to depart, but not without a special charge to the master
"<i>to bring no more such disordered persons!</i>"&mdash;<i>Hildreth Hist. U. S., vol. 1, 209</i>.</p></div>

St. Mary's was acquired, I will quote from a MS. copy of "A Relation of Maryland,
1635," now in my possession: "To make his entrie peaceable and safe,
he thought fit to present ye Werowance and Wisoes of the town (so they call
ye chief men of accompt among them,) with some English cloth (such as is
used in trade with ye Indians,) axes, hoes, and knives, which they accepted
verie kindlie, and freely gave consent toe his companie that hee and they should
dwell in one part of their towne, and reserved the other for themselves: and
those Indians that dwelt in that part of ye towne which was allotted for ye
English, freely left them their houses and some corne that they had begun to
plant: It was also agreed between them that at ye end of ye Harvest they
should have ye whole Towne, which they did accordinglie. And they made
mutuall promises to each other to live peaceably and friendlie together, and if
any injury should happen to be done, on any part, that satisfaction should be
made for ye same; and thus, on ye 27 <span class="smcap">Daie</span> of <span class="smcap">March</span>, A. D. 1634, ye Gouernour
took possession of ye place, and named ye <i>Towne&mdash;Saint Marie's</i>.
</p><p>
"There was an occasion that much facilitated their treatie with these Indians
which was this: the Susquehanocks (a warlike people that inhabit between
Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay) did usuallie make warres and incursions
upon ye neighboring Indians, partly for superioritie, partly for to gett their
women, and what other purchase they could meet with; which the Indians of
<i>Yoacomaco</i> fearing, had, ye yeere before our arivall there, made a resolution,
for there safetie, to remove themselves higher into ye countrie, where it was
more populous, and many of them where gone there when ye English arrived."
</p><p>
At Potomac, Father Altham,&mdash;according to Father White's Latin MS. in
the Maryland Hist. Soc. Col.&mdash;informed the guardian of the King that <i>we</i> (the
clergy) had not come thither for war, but for the sake of benevolence,&mdash;that we
might imbue a rude race with the principles of civilization, and open a way to
Heaven, as well as to impart to them the advantages enjoyed by distant regions.
The prince signified that we had come acceptably. The interpreter was one
of the Virginia Protestants. When the Father, for lack of time, could not continue
his discourse, and promised soon to return: "I will that it should be so,"
said Archihau&mdash;"our table shall be one; my men shall hunt for you; all
things shall be in common between us."
</p><p>
The Werowance of Pautuxent visited the strangers, and when he was about
departing, used the following language, as recorded in the MS. Relation of
Maryland of 1635: "I love ye English so well that if they should goe about to
kill me, if I had so much breath as to speak, I would command ye people not
to revenge my death; for I know they would not doe such a thinge except
it was through mine own default." See also Mr. B. U. Campbell's admirable
<span class="smcap">Sketch of the early missions to Maryland</span>, read before the Md.
Hist. Soc. 8th Jan. 1846, and subsequently printed in the U.S. Catholic
Magazine.</p></div>
